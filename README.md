Solution

As u can see, to solve this traditionally by reversing the process won't work because there's not enough data to do that. We have 3 unknown variables: the private key, the shared secret, and the message. In a modular system, it's likely impossible to figure out a solution with this data alone.

To solve this, we need to think more simply.

As u notice, the ciphertext is generated like: C = m * shared_key (without modular transformation), which will help us reverse this operation without a problem if we had one of them.

The solution is to factorize the ciphertext to prime factors and then retrieve all possible factors of it, which is computationally possible and even easy because C isn't like RSA modulus (two-prime composite) and cannot be controlled through the process to make it hard to factor.

After we get all the factors, we try with each one of them if it is the message using the long_to_bytes() function.

This approach will give us the message since multiplying by the shared key is just a scaling operation.

Sample Script

from Crypto.Util.number import long_to_bytes
from sympy.ntheory import factorint

c = 0x1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5a6b7c8d9e0f1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b9c0d1e2f3a4b5c6d7e8f9a0b1c2d3e4f5

factors = factorint(c)
candidates = [1]

for prime, exp in factors.items():
    candidates = [x * (prime ** e) for x in candidates for e in range(exp + 1)]

for shared_key in candidates:
    if c % shared_key != 0:
        continue
    m = c // shared_key
    try:
        msg = long_to_bytes(m)
        if b'CTF' in msg or b'{' in msg:
            print(f"[*] Found: {msg.decode()}")
            break
    except:
        continue

ðŸ§  The key idea: simple multiplication without mod means we can brute-force the shared key through factor trials.

ðŸ”Ž Just check each factor of C, divide C by that factor, and see if it converts cleanly into a readable message.
